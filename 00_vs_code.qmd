In this tutorial you will get familiar with the functionality of VS Code. A powerful IDE as it is, VS Code has a lot of features. However, even if you know the basics it will get you a long way. This tutorial is heavily based on the official [Tutorial: Get started with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started).

# Start Up

1.  Open Visual Studio Code. Then open a folder with **File** > **Open Folder...** or `Cmd+O`. On Linux/WSL users, you will first have to start a remote WSL session. With the WSL extension installed, you will see a new Status bar item at the far left.

    The Remote Status bar item can quickly show you in which context VS Code is running (local or remote) and clicking on the item will bring up the WSL extension commands.

    Alternatively, WSL users can open their Linux terminal, create a directory in their Linux distribution file system, change their directory and open it in VS Code WSL remote with `code .`:
    
    ```bash
    cd
    mkdir vscode101
    cd vscode101
    code .
    ```
    
    Note the `.` in front of `code`. You need to tell VS Code what you are opening. Later, we will see that you can open any file or directory with this command.
    :::

2.  Select **New Folder** and create a new folder named `vscode101`. Then select **Select Folder (Open on macOS)** to open the folder in VS Code.

3.  On the Workspace Trust dialog, select **Yes, I trust the authors** to enable all features in the workspace. If you do not see this dialog, then you probably have already opened this area before.

    Workspace Trust lets you decide whether code in your project folder can be executed by VS Code. When you download code from the internet, you should first review it to make sure it's safe to run. Get more info about [Workspace Trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/workspaces/workspace-trust).

4.  You should now see the **Explorer** view on the left, showing the name of the folder. Alongside terminal commands like `ls`, `tree`, and other commands, you can use the **Explorer** view to view and manage the files and folders in your workspace.

    ::: callout-note
    When you open a folder in VS Code, VS Code can restore the UI state for that folder, such as the open files, the active view, and the layout of the editor. You can also configure settings that only apply to that folder, or define debug configurations. Get more info about [workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started).
    :::

VS Code now considers the folder you've opened a workspace. You can also use `code .` in your terminal, especially for WSL users, to start a WSL remote session.
