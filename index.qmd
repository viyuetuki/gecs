# Aim

To provide an overview of core software development practices that support efficient research project management and its reproducibility.

# Descrition

Less time for programming, more time for science (and your other stuff).

# What this course is NOT?

-   Introduction to a specific programming language (e.g., Python, Bash, etc.)
-   Numerical simulations/modeling course
-   High Performance Computing (HPC) training

# Schedule

**Time:** 10:00-12:00 (Fridays)  
**Location:** L3B700 (near the GS counter)

| Part 1  |    |                      | Part 2 |    |                 |
|---------|----|----------------------|--------|----|-----------------|
| January | 16 | Terminal             | March  | 6  | Version Control |
|         | 23 | Virtual Environments |        | 13 | Testing         |
|         | 30 | Project Structure    |        | 27 | Automation      |

## Setting up
If you need help with configuring your computer for the course, a seession will be held on January 14 Wednesday at the Cafe Private Room during the lunchtime, 12:00-13:00. See [Setting up](00_setting-up.qmd) section.

# Target audience

This course is for researchers who want to learn how to automate repetitive tasks in data analysis. Some prior programming experience is helpful but not required.

# Manifesto

> "Teach a course you want to attend."

> adapted from Austin Kleon's ["A MANIFESTO: WRITE THE BOOK YOU WANT TO READ"](https://austinkleon.com/2008/12/18/a-manifesto-write-the-book-you-want-to-read/)

As cheese as it sounds, we are learinig from you (probably more at this point) that you will learn from this course. Stupid question permission is granted. Suggestions, tips, and corrections are welcome!

# Aknowledgements
