## Workspaces
Any use? A workspace for GECS.

# Pixi
1. Intstall Pixi using the default suggestion with Curl.
2. Create a virtual environment for this course.
    
    `pixi init gecs`

# Why Python?
Although the course advertises itself as programming language agnostic, Python will be used to provide 'meat' for coding and project examples.
